        Biomedical Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Electrical Engineering,
        Computer Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Informatics 
        have been working hard on industry and faculty sponsored projects to 
        solve real-world problems. Teams work collaboratively to carry ideas 
        from initial design through prototype fabrication, testing and evaluation 
        to validate their solutions. As Changemakers, our seniors also consider 
        issues related to ethics, economics, safety and professional practice 
        in their design solutions.`;

export const capstoneDescription: string = `The capstone projects are designed to go beyond the classroom to bridge
        the gap between industry and education, and is the final educational
        element that ties to together all the engineering, science, and
        humanities learnings as our students transition to the next phase of
        their lives. This event is an opportunity for our students, faculty,
        sponsors, alumni, and guests to come together to celebrate the
        completion of the projects. We invite you to meet our students and talk
        to them about their projects, their teamwork, and their problem-solving
        strategies.`;
